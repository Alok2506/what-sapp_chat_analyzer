20/05/23, 12:41 pm - Anshuman Rath// CSE: Some important topics in Java that everyone must do:-


1) Life cycles of threads/servlets, etc. 

Do it in such a way that you should be able to write complete details about each steps in process and you should be able to write code as well

2) JDBC is easy so everyone should do it (high chance that questions might come from here)

Especially do drivers and details about drivers in JDBC 

-learn to establish connection, create JDBC statements, execute SQL in JDBC and get resultset with closing connection in JDBC



-Difference between executeQuery(), executeUpdate() and execute() in JDBC, read 5-6 points of difference between each and some java code to show each


3) read multithreading and all concepts of threading with JDBC

4) do initialisation blocks in detail


5) event handling (especially mouse event and such different events with code)

6)in servlets read about tomcat 


7) try to do everything from unit 1,2,3 as they are very easy the ppt I've sent will be very beneficial for those 3 chapters
20/05/23, 12:42 pm - Anshuman Rath// CSE: And unit 1(nested classes, inner classes, local classes and anonymous classes are very important)

28/04/24, 1:22 am - Shashwat Gupta: Hello guys, as you know every year farewell party is organized by the 3rd year to say the goodbye to the 4th year. So, this time I think we should also do same, as you guys know as their were some misconvience happened with students in freshers, so to counter that sir has suggested to do this department wise and go with farewell party for CSE department. So every of 3rd year and 4th year will enjoy the party. So, please share your ideas and views about this and I welcome some of you to handle the whole event.
